Thanks for your interest in contributing! Contributions of all kinds are welcome — bug fixes, new features, docs, and more. **Provider and security contributions are especially valued since the tool is designed to be backend-agnostic.**

## Getting started

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/useFormseal/fetch.git
   cd formseal-fetch
   ```

2. Install in development mode using `pipx` (recommended) or `pip`:
   ```bash
   pipx install -e .
    ```
3. Verify it works:
   ```bash
   fsf
   ```

> **Note:** Always use `pipx install -e .` for local dev — it gives you an isolated environment and the version header will display correctly from source.

## Adding a new provider

Providers are storage backends that `fsf fetch` reads ciphertexts from. Each lives in its own sub-package under `fsf/providers/`.

**Detailed specs:** See [docs/providers/README.md](docs/providers/README.md)

**Quick structure:**
```
fsf/providers/<name>/
├── config.json    # Provider metadata
├── __init__.py  # Provider class
└── engine.py   # Fetch logic
```

**1. Create `config.json`:**
```json
{
  "display_name": "Display Name",
  "storage_type": "Storage Type (e.g., PostgreSQL)",
  "token_label": "API Token",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "name": "field_name",
      "description": "Field description",
      "required": true,
      "sensitive": false
    }
  ]
}
```

**2. Implement the provider in `__init__.py`:**
```python
from fsf.providers import BaseProvider
from fsf.providers.<name>.engine import run

class MyProvider(BaseProvider):
    name = "<name>"

    def _do_fetch(self, config):
        return run(config, debug=config.get("debug", False))

Provider = MyProvider
```

**3. Implement fetch logic in `engine.py`:**
```python
def run(config, debug=False):
    # your fetch logic
    return {"submission-id": b"ciphertext data"}
```

**4. Error handling:**

Catch exceptions and provide helpful messages:
```python
def run(config, debug=False):
    try:
        # fetch logic
        return {"key": b"value"}
    except Exception as e:
        err = str(e)
        if "connection" in err.lower():
            fail("""Unable to connect

Possible causes:
- Network/firewall blocking port
- Credentials incorrect

Run 'fsf fetch --debug' for details""")
        fail(f"Error: {err}" if debug else f"Error: {err}")
```

**5. Register it** in `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[tool.setuptools]
packages = [
    ...
    "fsf.providers.<name>",
]
```

**6. Verify:**
```bash
fsf providers
```

## Versioning

The version string lives in **`version.txt`** and is the single source of truth. The publish workflow reads it and injects it into the code at build time.

### For Contributors

1. Update `version.txt` with your proposed version (e.g., `2.6.0`)
2. Open a PR
3. The maintainer handles the release workflow after merge

### For Maintainers (Releasing)

When preparing a release:
1. Update `version.txt` with the new version (e.g., `2.6.0`)
2. Trigger the **Inject Version** workflow from GitHub Actions
3. Create a GitHub Release with the new version tag

---

## Code style

- Add a comment at the top of each logical block explaining what it does
- Follow the patterns already in the file you're editing
- Use the `ui.py` helpers (`info`, `fail`, `warn`, `br`, `header`) for all terminal output
- Sensitive config values must go through `security/tokens.py` (keyring-backed), never stored in plaintext config

---

## Submitting changes

1. Create a branch off `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/my-feature
   ```

2. Make your changes and test locally (see [Testing](#testing))

3. Commit with clear, descriptive messages

4. Push and open a pull request against `main`

---

## Testing

There is no automated test suite yet. Test the relevant commands manually before opening a PR:

```bash
fsf                          # check version header displays correctly
fsf providers                # verify your provider appears (if adding one)
fsf connect provider:<name>  # walk through the setup flow
fsf status                   # confirm credentials were saved
fsf fetch                    # fetch ciphertexts end-to-end
fsf disconnect               # confirm credentials are cleared
```
